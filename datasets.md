# CXD8530CQ Source Data Sets

Initial datasets are done by:
- The first dataset was made by Mikhail @zeptobars (M2, poly at 40x). Acid etching was used to obtain the dataset on poly, so the photos contain a lot of debris (bits of wires, dirt), but nevertheless all the necessary information can be extracted from it.
- The second set of M2 and M1 datasets was made by an anonymous decaper, but by the "signature" of the photos you can still tell by whom :smiley:

Datasets:

- M2, fine focus, a little bit of M1 is visible: http://psxdev.ru/download
- M2, bad focus (but M1 is visible): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PQ1_PY1s871K0953p8fsvvdBlgYIJ0lY/view?usp=sharing
