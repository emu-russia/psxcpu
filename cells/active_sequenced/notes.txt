01_02: DBL_CHK!!            (Notes: found NAND2X was actually NOT2)

[BOT]
03_01: DBL_CHK!!            (Notes: stitching artifacts, one of 6-NANDs can be resolved only by m1)
03_02: DBL_CHK!!
04_01: DBL_CHK!!            (Notes: very dirty. Fixed some cells. Found FILLER)
04_02: DBL_CHK!!            (Notes: MUX3X -> MUX2X)
05_01: DBL_CHK!!            (Notes: Row 58, very hard to recognize NAND,AND2X,NOT2, too many dirt and blurry m1)
05_02: DBL_CHK!!
