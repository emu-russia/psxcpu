Data that comes from "4_" output0-7 (signed) (direct mono value from IDCT for depth 0 and 1) and "res2_" output2-11 (signed) (YUV to RGB converted value for depth 2 and 3) needs to be rounded and clamped.

Depending on depth output clamping uses different inputs and ouput bits:

0) Depth output 00 (4bit)
Uses input from "4_" and output value to upper 4 bits of output (4-7).
Bits 0-3 of the output can be set but they don't used in futher operation.
Formula: output = clamp( -8, 7, ceil( input / 16.0f ) );

1) Depth output 01 (8bit)
Uses input from "4_" and mapped them directly to output.
Formula: output = input;

2) Depth output 10 (24bit)
Uses input from "res2_".
Formula: output = clamp( -128, 127, ceil( input / 8.0f ) );

3) Depth output 11 (15bit)
Uses input from "res2_" and output value to upper 5 bits of output (3-7).
Bits 0-2 of the output can be set but they don't used in futher operation.
Formula: output = clamp( -16, 15, ceil( input / 64.0f ) );

After rounding and clamping sign bit8 of output switched (xor) by data output signed flag set in MDEC(1) command (Decode Macroblock) bits 26 (0=Unsigned, 1=Signed)



After YUV to RGB conversion we need to pack data into 32bit for storing in Unit03 and following transfering to DMA. Packing process depends on data output depth set in MDEC(1) command (Decode Macroblock) bits 27-28 (0=4bit, 1=8bit, 2=24bit, 3=15bit).
Packing starts when pack_enable flag is 1 and paused when it's 0. Storing (generating of ie1 and ie2) and incrementing Unit03 address counter enabled only when ctrl4_s is 1.

Depending on depth output packing uses different number of clocks:

0) Depth output 00 (4bit)
Uses only upper 4 bits from input (4-7).
Whole packing process takes 8 cycles:
0x0000000F
0x000000F0
0x00000F00
0x0000F000
0x000F0000
0x00F00000
0x0F000000
0xF0000000 At the end of cycles we enable ie1 and ie2 for Unit03, store data and then increment address counter.

1) Depth output 01 (8bit)
Uses all 8 bits from input (0-7).
Whole packing process takes 8 cycles:
0x000000FF
0x0000FF00
0x00FF0000
0xFF000000 At the end of 4th cycle we enable ie1 and ie2 for Unit03, store data and then increment address counter.
0x000000FF
0x0000FF00
0x00FF0000
0xFF000000 At the end of cycles we enable ie1 and ie2 for Unit03, store data and then increment address counter.

2) Depth output 10 (24bit)
Uses all 8 bits from input (0-7).
Whole packing process takes 12 cycles:
0x000000FF
0xFF000000
0x0000FF00 At the end of 3rd cycle we enable ie1 for Unit03 and store data.
0x000000FF
0x00FF0000 At the end of 5th cycle we enable ie2 for Unit03, store data and then increment address counter.
0x0000FF00 At the end of 6th cycle we enable ie1 for Unit03 and store data.
0x00FF0000
0x0000FF00
0xFF000000 At the end of 9th cycle we enable ie2 for Unit03, store data and then increment address counter.
0x00FF0000
0x000000FF At the end of 11th cycle we enable ie1 for Unit03 and store data.
0xFF000000 At the end of 12th cycle we enable ie2 for Unit03, store data and then increment address counter.

3) Depth output 11 (15bit)
Uses only upper 5 bits from input (3-7). Last bit for whole 16 bit data taken from data output bit15 flag set in MDEC(1) command (Decode Macroblock) bits 25 (0=Clear, 1=Set).
Whole packing process takes 6 cycles:
0x0000001F
0x001F0000
0x000003E0
0x03E00000
0x0000FC00
0xFC000000 At the end of cycles we enable ie1 and ie2 for Unit03, store data and then increment address counter.

After packing and storing 32bit of data 8 times (when address counter is 7, 15, 23 and so on) we generate yuv_res_8 signal for MDEC control. Looks like this is signal to start transfering to DMA buffer. Signal is generated just before switching address counter to next value.
